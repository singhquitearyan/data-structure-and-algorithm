Problem Statement: Given a sorted array of N integers and an integer x, write a program to find the lower bound of x.

What is lower bound?
The lower bound algorithm finds the first or the smallest index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than or equal to a given key i.e. x.

The lower bound is the smallest index, ind, where arr[ind] >= x. But if any such index is not found, the lower bound algorithm returns n i.e. size of the given array.
